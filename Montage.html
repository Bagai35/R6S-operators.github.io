                        <b>Touré was born on October 11 in Bordeaux, France.</b> The son of an army officer 
                        and school teacher, he is the middle of four siblings with two older brothers and a 
                        younger sister. A few years after graduating high school, Touré began his law 
                        enforcement career as a uniformed police officer in the National Gendarmerie. 
                        They used his imposing form whenever there was a need to show a strong police 
                        presence, earning him a spot in the Mobile Gendarmerie where the focus was on 
                        crowd control as well as military and counter-terrorism patrol missions. Touré's 
                        push for extensive training provided him with a broad skillset and earned him a 
                        position in the GIGN.

                     <h1>Gameplay Description</h1>
                     <hr>
                     A Heavy Health Operator, Montagne comes equipped with his Extendable Shield, "Le Roc", which can 
                     fully cover him from head-to-toe while standing, providing extra protection that no other shield 
                     in the game offers. This also allows him to be the ultimate point-man, blocking enemy bullets as 
                     allies attack from his protection.  
                     When not extended, the Extendable Shield behaves like a normal Ballistic Shield.   <br> 
                    <i>Montagne will absorb 66% of damage dealt from any source of explosive damage. This applies to 
                    all operators standing behind the shield. </i>

                    <h1>Device Description</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <i><q>Can expand his Extendable Shield to offer full protection while standing.</i></q><br>
                        <br>
                        Le Roc was first issued in the late 1980s. A composite of reinforced alloys and Kevlar, 
                        its sturdiness and well-designed collapsible feature has made it a staple in GIGN 
                        operations for nearly thirty years. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Touré’s shield is the only original Le Roc still in service. Though it has seen its fair 
                        share of conflict, the device has become an extension of Touré, having saved his life and 
                        members of his team on multiple occasions. It will most likely remain on active duty 
                        until Touré retires.
