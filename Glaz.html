                        <b>Timur "Glaz" Glazkov was born and raised in the seaport city of Vladivostok, Russia on July 2.</b>
                        It was here that his father worked in the shipping industry and Timur studied art in secondary school. 
                        In 2004, the deaths that resulted from the Beslan school hostage crisis inspired him to transfer 
                        to the Cadet Corps and pursue a career in the armed forces. Afterwards, he attended the Khabarovsk 
                        Military Commanders Training Academy where he developed unparalleled marksmanship. He also regularly 
                        participated in cross-border training exercise with China where he gained a strong understanding of 
                        Mandarin. After the Academy, he joined the Ground Forces of the Russian Federation and later the 
                        Spetsnaz 45th Guards Regiment. Assigned to special ops and VIP protection detail, reports consistently 
                        show that Glaz possesses a unique creative approach to problem solving. He is the squad member 
                        with the most expertise in long-range scoped weaponry.

                     long-range marks even through smoke for easier shooting.    <br>
