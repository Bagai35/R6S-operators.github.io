                                needs to know is, 'Does it do the job, or doesn't it?' And let me tell

                        <b>Jordan Trace was born in Plano, Texas. </b> to the town having a major 
                            concentration of Chinese Americans, Trace grew up to have a conversational 
                            level of Mandarin. Trace joined the Corps straight out of high school, 
                            making him a fourth-generation Marine. Following his first tour of Iraq, 
                            he obtained enough experience to volunteer as an explosive ordnance 
                            disposal technician. After his second tour of Iraq, Trace returned to 
                            the U.S., enrolled at Texas A&M, and earned a Bachelor of Science in 
                            Chemistry. He brought his experiences and skills to the FBI, where he 
                            spent fours years as a field agent with the Hazardous Materials Response 
                            Unit. It was during this time that he met Detective Apha "Aruni" 
                            Tawanroong of the Royal Thai Police. During an operation in Bangkok, 
                            Trace and Tawanroong were tracking down a weapons racket when a bomb 
                            had been discovered. Transporting the bomb in a pick-up truck through 
                            the streets of Bangkok, Trace attempted to defuse it. He ultimately 
                            failed when the truck suffered a head-on collision. As a result of the 
                            accident and explosion, Tawanroong lost her left arm and leg while 
                            Trace only suffered third-degree burns to his hands and arms. Trace 
                            later recovered from his injuries though he felt responsible for Tawanroong's 
                            injuries.

                        A Medium Health Operator, Thermite is equipped with two Brimstone BC-3 Exothermic Charges. 
                       These charges can breach through any Reinforced Wall within three seconds of activation.   <br> 
                       <i>Exothermic Charges can be deployed on any destructible surface, including reinforced ones. </i>
                        <hr>

                        <h1>Device Description</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <i><q>Uses two Shock Drones to disable traps or injure enemies.
                             Deploys the first Shock Drone during the preparation phase</q></i><br>
                        <br>
                        The Shock Drone can scout locations and deliver an electric shock via probes 
                        that can incapacitate electrical devices and be used as a distraction toward hostiles. 
                        The chassis holds multiple shots. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Developed from Skell Technology, the first official deployment of the RSD Model 1 
                        was during a hostage situation in Paris. A mentally unstable suspect barricaded 
                        himself in a convenience store along with several hostages. GIGN was deployed
                        and sought to resolve the situation without violence. Pichon was on site and
                         was able to maneuver the drone close enough to the suspect to deliver a slight 
                         shock, forcing the suspect to drop his weapon, where he was incapacitated by an 
                         undercover operative. The incident was resolved with zero fatalities.
