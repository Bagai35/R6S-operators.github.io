                        <b>Weiss' mother is a renowned mathematician and her father 
                            is an inventor whose high academic standards encouraged 
                            Weiss and her siblings to win numerous awards in math, 
                            science, and music throughout their school years. 
                            Thriving in the gifted program enabled Weiss to complete 
                            her first internship with a local tech company at the age 
                            of sixteen. She was invited to MIT, where she focused on 
                            electrical engineering, achieving accolades for her research 
                            in Microelectronics. Weiss then joined Caltech for graduate 
                            studies in experimental electrical engineering. Weiss returned 
                            to Germany after traveling the world for a year to work with 
                            military technology research before joining the Bundespolizei 
                            (BPOL) as an officer. Both the physical and mental challenges 
                            of the job appealed to Weiss and she quickly moves through the 
                            ranks. After two years with the BPOL, she was recruited by the GSG 9.

                     A Light Health Operator, IQ's unique gadget is the RED Mk III "Spectre", which can 
                     locate any electronic device in the immediate vicinity.  <br>

                        <h1>Device Description</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <i><q>Uses the Electronics Detector to locate any electronics in range through obstacles such as walls.</q></i><br>
                        <br>
                        The advent of complex electronics on battlefields has created a pressing need for 
                        more advanced types of portable, ground-based sensors. Inspired by Forward Looking 
                        Infrared technology, the RED Mk III “Spectre” displays any active electronic components 
                        in the immediate vicinity of the user, from IEDs to various types of specialized military gear. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Weiss designed the prototype for the RED Mk I while a Ph.D. candidate at CalTech. 
                        She has maintained a firm hand in monitoring the subsequent models of the device, 
                        as dictated in her licensing agreement with the manufacturer.
