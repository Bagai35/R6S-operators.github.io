                        <b>Baker and James "Smoke" Porter teamed up and joined forces with SDU Operator Liu "Lesion" 
                            Tze Long on the latter's first operation, Operation Green Viper. Upon completion of the 
                            mission, the two helped celebrate Lesion's first successful mission with an extra day in 
                            Macau, filing the event as an off-duty bonus.

                            A veteran of three wars, Baker was the oldest SAS operative on active duty until he 
                            was recruited by Rainbow in 2015. With extensive field experience and proficiency in 
                            SAS tactics, Baker was a critical asset to any Rainbow operation. He has honed his 
                            expertise with protective measures and electronic counter-measures and frequently worked 
                            with engineers to advance the equipment. As a Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental 
                            Sergeant Major) Baker served as a respected and effective mentor to new recruits.

                     A Medium Health Operator, Thatcher 
                     is equipped with three EG MKO-EMP 
                     Grenades. These grenades disable all 
                     electronics that are within its area of effect. 

                        <h1>Device Description</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <i><q>Uses EMP Grenades to disable any electronics in range</q></i><br>
                        <br>
                        The EMP's efficiency in anti-electronic warfare has been known and studied 
                        since the early 1960s and features prominently in media depictions, but practical 
                        battlefield applications have eluded CTU squads until very recently. Team Rainbow's 
                        engineers recently made a breakthrough in solving the problem of creating a localized 
                        fission reaction, while keeping gamma radiation to tolerable levels, resulting 
                        in the EG MKO-EMP Grenade, a personal handheld device. No one is more suited to 
                        wield this novel device than Thatcher, known for his warnings against over-reliance on technology.
