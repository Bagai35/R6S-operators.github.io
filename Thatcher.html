                        <b>Baker and James "Smoke" Porter teamed up and joined forces with SDU Operator Liu "Lesion" 
                            Tze Long on the latter's first operation, Operation Green Viper. Upon completion of the 
                            mission, the two helped celebrate Lesion's first successful mission with an extra day in 
                            Macau, filing the event as an off-duty bonus.

                            A veteran of three wars, Baker was the oldest SAS operative on active duty until he 
                            was recruited by Rainbow in 2015. With extensive field experience and proficiency in 
                            SAS tactics, Baker was a critical asset to any Rainbow operation. He has honed his 
                            expertise with protective measures and electronic counter-measures and frequently worked 
                            with engineers to advance the equipment. As a Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental 
                            Sergeant Major) Baker served as a respected and effective mentor to new recruits.

                       1.  Thatcher is equipped with three EG MKO-EMP Grenades. These grenades disable 
                       all electronics that are within its area of effect.  <br> 
                       <i>When an EMP Grenade is tossed, they will let out an electromagnetic pulse 
                        after 3 seconds, disabling defender gadgets caught within its 5.2 meter radius.</i>
                        <hr>
                        2. The following gadgets will be disabled for 10 seconds if they are caught within the EMP radius <br>
                        <i>If there were heartbeats when affected by the EMP blast, the heartbeat icon will stay in place for the disabled duration.</i> <br>
                        <hr>
                        3. Aside from Gadgets, the EMP also affects some defender weapon attachments caught in its radius: <br>
                        Defender Electronic Sights (i.e. Red Dot Sight, Reflex Sight, Holographic Sight) caught within 
                        the EMP radius will be disabled for 15 seconds, during which their reticle will disappear.

                         While breaching hammers are nothing new to CTU or law enforcement operations,
                        “The Caber” is unique due to its exceptional size and weight.
                        Such dimensions would be impractical in the hands of most agents but Sledge’s 
                        exceptional physical prowess make it a formidable presence on the battlefield, 
                        allowing for quick and effective breaches.
                        <br><br>
                        Sledge’s breaching hammer was directly inspired by CTU battering rams. There are
                        four kinds of breaching tools: mechanical, ballistic, explosive and thermal. 
                        Using sledgehammers or other blunt objects to breach is known as mechanical breaching, 
                        and often serves as a relatively quiet supplement compared to the other, more 
                        attention-grabbing methods. Mechanical breaching was used during the Iranian 
                        Embassy Siege to gain access to rooms and is still used in modern-day conflicts 
                        in tight urban zones where ballistic or explosive breaching methods carry more risk.
