                        </div>
                        <b>Kötz is a graduate of Hermann-Böse-Gymnasium, an elite academy specializing 
                        in science and language studies.</b>
                        Throughout his education Kötz excelled both academically and athletically. 
                        Among his many unique qualities, Kötz is multilingual with the ability to 
                        grasp the nuance of language quickly. His physically imposing frame and 
                        skill with his weapon make him formidable in tight space, room-to-room 
                        deployment. It's his tactical experience that secures him as a solid 
                        Rainbow elite. These abilities combed with his specialized academic
                         background and good-natured personality make him highly sought after.
                          He easily transitioned from a Schnelle Kräfte soldier in Kosovo to 
                          a member of the GSG 9. Kötz has been integral to fostering training 
                          practices and good will between India's National Security Guard and 
                          GSG 9.

                     A Medium Armored Operator, Blitz's unique gadget is the G52-Tactical Shield, a Ballistic Shield loaded with 
                     forward-facing flash charges that Blitz can manually detonate, blinding anyone within the Shield's range. 
                     Unlike other Shield Operators, Blitz can also wield his shield up while sprinting.  <br> 
                    
                    <h1>Device Description</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <i><q>Triggers the flash attached to his ballistic shield to temporarily blind enemies.</i></q><br>
                        <br>
                        Kötz has been a fan of flashbang entry methods since joining the Schnelle Kräfte, 
                        preferring to disorient to limit collateral damage, unlike other explosive entry methods.
                         The G52-Tactical Shield allows Kötz to quickly advance after firing a row and remain
                          protected from frontal attacks as he moves to aid teammates or hostages. 
                          <br> <br>
                         Inspired by ballistic shields fashioned with strobe lights, the G52-Tactical 
                        Shield takes this technology one step further. By replacing a high-intensity
                        light source with three rows of eight flashbang grenades, the G52 allows for
                         a bold and calculated entrance where the aim is to incapacitate rather than maim potential targets.
