                        <b>Jenson grew up in a comfortable upper middle-class family with no military history. 
                            He decided that he wanted to be a Navy SEAL at a young age. He sought to break the 
                            family tradition of being involved in medical sciences and devoted his life to 
                            achieving his goal. With the help of his father, a kinesiology professor at the 
                            University of Washington, he joined the Boy Scouts of America and the United Sates 
                            Naval Sea Cadet Corps (Blue Angels Squadron) at the age of twelve. 
                            <br>
                            This solidified his desire to serve his country and see the world. 
                            Jenson enlisted in the United States Navy at eighteen. 
                            Joining the military offered him the ideal opportunity 
                            to pursue an academic education while learning a wide 
                            range of skills that fueled his adventurous spirit. 
                            After his initial military stint, Jenson eventually succeeded 
                            in his ultimate goal of joining the US Navy SEALs. 
                            At some point he worked as a SEAL instructor, meeting 
                            Meghan Castellano during her training. Jenson later 
                            married and had kids. In 2016, he was recruited into Rainbow.

                     A Medium Health Operator, Blackbeard's unique gadgets are his two Transparent Armored Rifle-Shields (TARS). They protect his head from a couple bullets, allowing a slightly higher survivability rate at the cost of mobility and recoil control.

                        <h1>Device Description</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <i><q>Deploys a ballistic shield on his rifle that can be swapped if the first one gets damaged.</q></i><br>
                        <br>
                        The TARS Mk 0, Transparent Armored Rifle-Shield, or simply "Rifle-Shield", is a prototype 
                        based on the armor shield technology for tank gunners. It allows Blackbeard to increase 
                        his mobile protection without diminishing his field of vision.
