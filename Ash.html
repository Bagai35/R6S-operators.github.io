                            Cohen's mother is a renowned Jewish political activist and professor while her Palestinian 
                            father is a professor of Middle Eastern Studies. Cohen was raised in Israel, excelling 
                            in Mathematics and Physics. She earned a degree in Structural Engineering at Tel Aviv 
                            University and spent a few semesters at Boston University.

                            Cohen then enlisted in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). After undergoing the rigorous 
                            twenty-two month training for the elite Air Force unit, Shaldag, she served five years. 
                            Skilled in ground and airborne operations, all-weather and all-terrain navigation and 
                            reconnaissance, she was invaluable in Operation Orchard. She was later transferred to 
                            FBI SWAT due to an international law enforcement exchange program. Cohen applied her 
                            degree in Engineering and gift in structural resistance to develop advanced demolition 
                            tactics and equipment. She later met fellow officer Miles "Castle" Campbell whom she 
                            became close friends with.

                     <h1>Gameplay Description</h1>
                     <hr>
                     A Light Health Operator, Ash comes equipped with the M120 CREM. It can shoot up to two 
                     Breaching Rounds, which will burrow into a surface and detonate automatically. 
                     <hr>
                       1.  Ash is equipped with a single-shot grenade launcher that can fire 
                       Breaching Rounds. When one Breaching Round is fired, Ash reloads the grenade 
                       launcher with her next Breaching Round.   <br> 

                       <i>Breaching Rounds are unaffected by gravity and do not drop off at any range, meaning they could travel forever. <br>
                        Breaching Rounds have no projectile size; they can pass through openings that are as small as a bullet hole. <br>
                        Breaching Rounds have a radius of 3 meters.</i>
                        <hr>
                        2. After striking a surface, the Breaching Round will stick to the surface and explode after 2 seconds <br>
                        <i>If there were heartbeats when affected by the EMP blast, the heartbeat icon will stay in place for the disabled duration. <br>

                            Breaching Rounds are unaffected by Mute's Signal Disruptors and electricity from Bandit's Shock Wires or Kaid's Electroclaws.</i>
                        <hr>
                        3. Aside from Gadgets, the EMP also affects some defender weapon attachments caught in its radius: <br>
                        Defender Electronic Sights (i.e. Red Dot Sight, Reflex Sight, Holographic Sight) caught within 
                        the EMP radius will be disabled for 15 seconds, during which their reticle will disappear.

                    <h1>Device Description</h1>
                         <hr>
                         <i><q>Uses a Breaching Hammer to breach through destructible surfaces.</q></i><br>
                         While breaching hammers are nothing new to CTU or law enforcement operations,
                        “The Caber” is unique due to its exceptional size and weight.
                        Such dimensions would be impractical in the hands of most agents but Sledge’s 
                        exceptional physical prowess make it a formidable presence on the battlefield, 
                        allowing for quick and effective breaches.
                        <br> <br>
                        Sledge’s breaching hammer was directly inspired by CTU battering rams. There are
                        four kinds of breaching tools: mechanical, ballistic, explosive and thermal. 
                        Using sledgehammers or other blunt objects to breach is known as mechanical breaching, 
                        and often serves as a relatively quiet supplement compared to the other, more 
                        attention-grabbing methods. Mechanical breaching was used during the Iranian 
                        Embassy Siege to gain access to rooms and is still used in modern-day conflicts 
                        in tight urban zones where ballistic or explosive breaching methods carry more risk.
