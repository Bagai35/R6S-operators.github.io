                        <b>A Montreal native, Côté comes from a long line of military veterans. 
                            The middle of three, Côté grew up in a close-knit family. 
                            Côté always wanted to lead an unconventional life. To achieve this, 
                            he enrolled in the Canadian Armed Force Reserves via the Regular 
                            Officer Training Plan, which allowed him to attend Université du 
                            Québec and obtain a bachelors in criminology. After graduation, 
                            he enlisted full time in the Canadian Army and was assigned to the 
                            Military Police. After separating from the military, Côté joined 
                            the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His specialized training in 
                            high-risk situations, both long- and close-range, marine rescue, 
                            and armed ship boarding allowed him easy acceptance to join 
                            the RCMP Emergency Response Team. 
                            <br>
                            After excelling in his ERT role he was invited by the Canadian 
                            military to re-up and become a member of JTF2. Côté continued 
                            to expand his repertoire of skills, including high-speed tactical 
                            driving on both land and water, hazardous materials management, 
                            and hostage rescue. In 2015, he was recruited to join Rainbow 
                            alongside Tina Lin Tsang.

                     <h1>Gameplay Description</h1>
                     <hr>
                     A Medium Health Operator, Buck's unique gadget is an underbarrel 
                     shotgun mounted under his weapon known as the "Skeleton Key", 
                     otherwise designated as the SK 4-12. The shotgun has a higher 
                     destructive potential than any of the other shotguns.

                        <hr>
                        <i><q>Toggles under-barrel shotgun attachment on his main weapon.</q></i><br>
                        <br>
                        The Skeleton Key, an under-barrel mounted 12 gauge shotgun, allows 
                        Buck to swiftly breach and target hostiles. By changing hand 
                        positions on his assault rifle, he is able to quickly switch 
                        from ranged to close-quarter combat. The Skeleton Key is also 
                        an effective breaching tool to destroy barricades or create a 
                        line of sight.
