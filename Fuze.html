                        <b>Growing up in a military family in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Shuhrat Kessikbayev immigrated to Russia 
                        shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union.</b>
                        His parents encouraged him and his brother to embrace all that was Russian, 
                        so it wasn't until his teens when he learned to embrace his Uzbek heritage.
                        Kessikbayev and his brother followed in their father's footsteps and enrolled
                        in the military. Showing an aptitude for science at an early age, the military
                        honed Kessikbayev's interest in mechanical engineering and trained him to be
                        a mechanist.

                     A Heavy Health Operator, Fuze carries four APM-6 "Matryoshka" Cluster Charges capable
                      of clearing rooms by deploying five sub-grenades through destructible structures such as walls, floors, and windows. <br> 
                    
                    <h1>Device Description</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <i><q>Uses Cluster Charges that pierce and stick to walls, releasing sub-grenades on the opposing side</i></q><br>
                        <br>
                        First developed by Fuze in the Ratnik experimental weaponry brigade, the APM-6 "Matryoshka" was 
                        Kessikbayev’s attempt to create a more powerful breach charge. It proved to be an effective means 
                        of clearing a room, dealing the most damage to hostiles while keeping the Operator relatively 
                        safe. The "Matryoshka" can be anchored either vertically or horizontally. Once deployed, the 
                        piston burrows through walls or floors, dispersing live cluster grenades while spinning to
                        deal the most damage from any directions. <br>
                        The "Matryoshka" is most useful in conditions where collateral damage is not a concern. 
                        Not recommended for hostage extractions, or in areas where there is a high risk of friendly fire.
