                        <b>Cowden is an Attacking Operator featured in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</b>
                        Born in the far north of Scotland, Cowden's military father and nurse mother moved
                        to Inverness with him and his three siblings when he was five. His athleticism
                        elevated him to the position of Captain  of the 1998 Scotland National under-20
                        Rugby Union Team. Following a long family tradition of military service, Cowden
                        joined the 3rd UK Mechanised Division of the British Army at age 18. His drive
                        and physique suit the divisions's historical nickname of "Iron Sides." Cowden's 
                        first assignment was in the Armoured Division where he studied engineering and
                        specialized in upgrading the infantry combat vehicles. From there, he developed
                        various breaching tactics. After five years of active duty, he was recruited
                        into the SAS, where he holds multiple records in speed and strength. An expert
                        in mechanical, ballistic, explosive and thermal breaching strategies,
                        Cowden was recruited into Rainbow in 2015. He is the operator to choose
                        for quick and relatively silent destruction.

                       1. The Breaching Hammer creates a rectangular hole on surfaces it strikes. <br> 
                       <i>The Breaching Hammer behaves as if it deals explosive damage; it can 
                        destroy many bulletproof gadgets, such as Barbed Wire, Deployable Shields, 
                        Castle's Armor Panels, Azami's Kiba Barriers, Bulletproof Camera and Maestro's 
                        Evil Eyes.</i>
                        <hr>
                        2. The Breaching Hammer has a limited durability of twenty-five charges, 
                        shown by a bar above the hammer's gadget icon. Breaching a wall consumes 
                        two charges while breaching a barricade and hitting anything else (including flooring) 
                        takes one. Environmental props count as one hit. <br>
                        <i>The Hammer can't break through non-destructible surfaces or a Reinforced Wall - 
                        attempting to do so will only consume durability. <br>
                        Sledge's breaching hammer is capable of killing enemies in one hit, which counts as 2 charges.</i>
                        <hr>
                        3. Like other gadgets in the game, Sledge takes a moment to unequip his hammer after using it.
                         This half second delay will leave him vulnerable, but only for a short period.
